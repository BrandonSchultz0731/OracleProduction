# OracleProduction
Java Project- Step 1
Welcome to the Oracle Production Java Application! This program demonstates the use of abstract classes, interfaces, enums,
implementation, and how they all interact with each other.

Interface Item:
This type of class is called an Interface. An interface is similar to that of an abstract class, as in you can not create an instance
of the class, however, unlike abstract classes, you can not create method bodies in an interface. Instead, an interface is used to
define methods to be used in other classes, like abstract classes.

Abstract Class Product:
This class is an abstract class, which means that this class can not be instantiated, so no object can be created from this
class. The methods used in this class are from the ones defined in our Item interface, so now we implement them in this class.

Enum ItemType:
Enums are nothing more than the ability to represent a list of constants that can be implemented in other classes, like interfaces.
By creating a list, we can use these values in another class as constants, which we will soon implement in later steps.
